# Cimate Change Affecting Crop Yields
The project is about how climate has affected the production of crops from the past 50-60 years.
Here wheat , sugarcane and rice have been focussed in different popular countries.
Visulaization have been done with the help of line plot graph to make it easy to understand.

## Sugarcane
I have taken an example of Nigeria and then made an analysis of the production. Nigeria is self sufficient when comes to Sugarcane and it also exports Sugarcane to different countries.
## Wheat
Visulaized the production of wheat in South Korea for 60 years. South Korea is not self sufficient when comes to wheat hence imports wheat from US the most.
## Rice
Analysis done on production of rice in China which is the highest rice producing country but still is not 1st in importing rice.
### Dataset
Dataset referred is from NASA. (GISTEMP)
